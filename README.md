## Zoomcamp-DE-2026

# Repository Overview
This repository is a personal learning workspace created as part of Zoomcamp 2026, focusing on building strong fundamentals and practical skills in data engineering, analytics, and modern data workflows.
The goal of this repo is not only to complete the course materials, but also to:
- Practice real-world data problems
- Build reproducible pipelines
- Document learning in a structured and transparent way
- Create a reference that can be reused beyond the program

# Objectives
Through this repository, I aim to:
- Understand core concepts behind data pipelines and analytics systems
- Apply best practices in data modeling, orchestration, and automation
- Learn by doing — from raw data ingestion to analysis-ready outputs
- Develop a habit of clean documentation and version-controlled workflows

# Repository Structure
This repository is organized by modules and exercises from Zoomcamp 2026, with additional notes, experiments, and improvements added along the way.
Each folder may include:
- Source code
- Configuration files
- Notes and explanations
- Outputs or experiment results
